    :description """
        systemd is a system management daemon designed
        exclusively for the Linux kernel API. For systems
        using it, it is the first process to execute in
        user space during the Linux startup
        process. Therefore, it is also the parent process
        of all child processes in user space. The name
        systemd adheres to the Unix convention of making
        daemons easier to distinguish by appending the
        letter d to the filename. """ ;
        :Overview """

    Systemd was developed for Linux to replace the
    init system inherited from UNIX System V and
    Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating
    systems. Like init, systemd is a daemon that
    manages other daemons. All daemons, including
    systemd, are background processes. Systemd is the
    first daemon to start (during booting) and the
    last daemon to terminate (during shutdown).

    Lennart Poettering and Kay Sievers, the software
    engineers who initially developed systemd,[1]
    sought to surpass the efficiency of the init
    daemon in several ways. They wanted to improve the
    software framework for expressing dependencies; to
    allow more processing to be done concurrently or
    in parallel during system booting; and to reduce
    the computational overhead of the shell.""" ;
